  <li><h2>The EXPOSat mission appears to be a follow-up to the AstroSAT mission, ISRO's multi-wavelength X-ray astronomy observatory studying X-ray sources in the universe.</h2></li>
  <li><h2>Considering the great success of AstroSAT, the EXPOSat mission will further explore X-rays in the universe — specifically, the polarisation of bright X-ray sources in our universe.</h2></li>
  <li> <h2>These objects could be neutron stars, supernova remnants, pulsars and regions around black holes that could give scientists information about the electromagnetic nature of space radiation.</h2></li>
  <li><h2>Understanding space radiation better could be used to protect spacecraft and astronauts in the future, but also pave the way for space technology to better understand happenings in the universe.</h2></li>
  <li><h2>These, K Sivan said at the briefing, are only some of the planned interplanetary missions ISRO has in mind for the decade to come.</h2></li>
