<ul>
  <li><h2>The Aditya-L1 mission is ISRO's first planned probe to study the Sun's corona and its atmosphere.</h2></li>
  <li><h2> It is expected to launch during 2019–2020 on a PSLV rocket from Sriharikota. </h2></li>
  <li> <h2>The corona is the outer layer of the Sun, which extends thousands of km above the visible disc around it.</h2></li>
  <li><h2>Interestingly, it has temperatures over a million degree Kelvin — far higher than the surface of the Sun (6000 degrees Kelvin).</h2></li>
  <li><h2>How the corona gets heated to such high temperatures is still an unanswered question in solar physics, and something NASA's Parker probe is currently exploring.</h2></li>
  <li> <h2>ISRO's Aditya L-1 will also soon follow suit and study this astrophysical mystery.</h2></li>
